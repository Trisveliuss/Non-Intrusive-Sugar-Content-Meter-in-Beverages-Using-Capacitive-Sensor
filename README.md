This repository documents the final undergraduate thesis project titled "Design and Development of a Non-Intrusive Sugar Content Measurement Device Using a Capacitive Sensor", developed by Tristan Novelius Wibowo as part of the completion requirements for a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering.

The project aims to design and implement a device that measures the sugar concentration (in degrees Brix) of beverages using a capacitive sensing method without direct contact with the liquid. Unlike traditional approaches such as refractometry, which require sampling and can be intrusive or destructive, this method allows for non-intrusive, fast, and repeatable measurements based on dielectric property changes in the liquid.

The device uses a capacitive sensor to detect changes in permittivity due to varying sugar levels. A sinusoidal signal is generated using an XR2206 function generator and applied to the sensor. The resulting signal, which reflects changes in capacitance, is processed through analog circuitry and digitized using a 16-bit ADS1115 ADC module. The digital data is then displayed on a 128x64 OLED screen for real-time monitoring. The system is powered by a dual symmetric ±15V power supply to ensure stable operation of both analog and digital components, especially those involving operational amplifiers and precision analog circuits.

Experimental results on sugar solutions ranging from 10 to 50 °Brix showed that as the sugar concentration increases, the dielectric constant of the solution decreases, resulting in a lower capacitance. Consequently, the output voltage also decreases. This inverse relationship confirms the effectiveness of capacitive sensing for monitoring sugar content in liquids, offering a viable and non-destructive alternative to conventional techniques.

This project demonstrates the integration of analog signal processing, precision sensing, and microcontroller-based interfacing for real-time, non-intrusive measurement systems in food and beverage analysis.
